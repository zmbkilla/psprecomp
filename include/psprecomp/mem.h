/* psprecomp — PSP memory map.
 *
 * The Allegrex has no TLB. Addresses are decoded by their top bits into a
 * handful of fixed regions, which makes the recompiled memory path cheap:
 * mask off the segment bits, index a flat host allocation.
 *
 *   0x00010000-0x00013FFF   scratchpad  (16 KB, fast on-chip)
 *   0x04000000-0x041FFFFF   VRAM        (2 MB)
 *   0x08000000-0x09FFFFFF   main RAM    (32 MB on PSP-2000+, 24 MB usable
 *                                        on PSP-1000 where it ends at 0x09FFFFFF
 *                                        but only 0x087FFFFF is user memory)
 *
 * Each region is mirrored at three segment bases, which differ only in cache
 * behaviour — irrelevant to us, so we fold them together:
 *   0x0.......  kernel, cached
 *   0x4.......  uncached mirror
 *   0x8.......  kernel-only, cached
 * We mask with PSP_ADDR_MASK to collapse all three onto one backing store.
