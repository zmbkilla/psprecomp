/* Function discovery — recursive descent over Allegrex code.
 *
 * The emitter needs to know where functions begin and end. Nothing in a
 * stripped PRX says so directly, so we recover it by following control flow
 * from a set of seeds until nothing new is reachable.
 *
 * The signals we lean on, in order of reliability:
 *
 *   1. `jal <target>` — a direct call. Its target is a function entry, full
 *      stop. This is by far the strongest signal and most of a module is
 *      discovered through it.
 *   2. `jr $ra` — a return, and therefore a function end. The decoder
 *      distinguishes this from `jr $rN` precisely so discovery can rely on it;
 *      conflating them either truncates every function at its first jump table
 *      or never closes one at all.
 *   3. The module's entry point and its exported function addresses, as seeds.
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT do is scan linearly for function prologues.
 * That finds more, but it also finds data that happens to look like a
 * prologue, and a wrong function boundary produces C that compiles and
 * silently misbehaves. Recursive descent under-approximates, which is the
 * right direction to be wrong in: everything it reports is genuinely reachable
 * code, and what it misses shows up as unreached bytes we can go and account
 * for.
