/* The C emitter — turning discovered functions into readable native C.
 *
 * One `psp_func_<addr>` per discovered function, every line carrying its
 * address and original disassembly as a comment, lowered to the helpers in
 * <psprecomp/recomp_rt.h>. The output is meant to be *read*, not merely
 * compiled: a recomp project is only useful to other people if they can open
 * the generated file and see what the original was doing.
 *
 * The hard part is delay slots. Every MIPS branch and jump executes the
 * instruction *after* it before control transfers, and "likely" branches
 * nullify theirs when not taken. See the notes in emit.c — that single
 * detail is where most of this file's care goes.
